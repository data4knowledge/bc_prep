  shortName: Biospecimen Type
definition: A yellow, oily liquid nitrosamine that solidifies at cold temperatures
  and emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition. Nitrosonornicotine
  is found in tobacco products and is likely produced by the nitrosation of nicotine
  during the making and smoking of tobacco products. This substance is only used in
  research to induce tumors in experimental animals. Exposure to nitrosonornicotine
  affects the liver and nitrosonornicotine is reasonably anticipated to be a human
  carcinogen. (NCI05)
