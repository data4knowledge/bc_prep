  shortName: Biospecimen Type
definition: The major metabolite of the potentially carcinogenic nitrosamine 4-methylnitrosamino-1,3-pyridyl-1-butanone
  (nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone; NNK) that is detected in the urine of subjects
  exposed to tobacco products. 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (nicotine-derived
  nitrosamine alcohol; NNAL) is produced by carbonyl reduction of NNK and may also
  be a carcinogen.
